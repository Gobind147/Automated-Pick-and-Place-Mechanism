# Automated-Pick-and-Place-Mechanism

Mechatronics:- PICK AND PLACE ROBOTIC ARM : Involves the application of ARDUINO, Color Detecting Sensor and Motors.
Term project: During the course of Mechatronics laboratory in spring semester 2022, Mechanical systems design , M.Tech , IIT Kharagpur.

1. User presses a button corresponding to a particular ball which he desires.
2. The primary motor starts and the color sensor recieves input corresponding to a particular color as it moves forward.
3. When the color is detected the primary motor stops.
4. The secondary motor(vertical arm) starts and lowers the gripper.
5. The gripper servo motor starts and picks the object.
6. The secondary motor rotates in opposite direction.
7. As the secondory motor reaches its original position, the primary starts rotating in the reverse directinon bring the whole assembly at home position.
8. Again, the secondary motor runs lowering the vertical assembly.
9. The gripper motor rotates, dropping the item.
10. The secondary motor rotates in reverse direction and the model achieves the intial starting position.



### NOTE:- Some parts of the program are repeatable and therefore separate functions can be defined.
